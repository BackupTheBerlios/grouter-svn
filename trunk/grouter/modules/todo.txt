========= Router ===================
- RouterService should be accessible through RMI -> stopping and starting different nodes.
:: Done, needs test cases.

- Globeal jobs in scheduler using Quartz - removing files from backup folder and zipping them together.

-

- Move from calling persist on a message from a router to using jms and ActiveMQ. Investigate more on this.

- Investigate support for web services - would be nice to have a specification wsdl and dynamiccaly bind to
this wsdl for a nodes inbound / outbound endpoints.

- Investigate support for JMS - should be pretty easy. Either use own classes (jms strategy ones in util) or use
SPrings JMS support for pojos.

- Transformers and filters. Start with filters since they are easier.

=========  Domain ==================
- Implement more test on DAO and Service layer -> check coverage and increase as much as possible.
:: In progress

- CRUD , users, nodes, messages
:: In progress

- Nice to have, Jamon

- Nice to have, script for postgresql. Move to postgrssql in the future. Having problem with multiple FK constraints in mysql...

- Implement FTP reader writer in Router
:: Ftp reader implemented with inmemory tests.

- Implement HTTP reader writer in Router

======== Presentation layer ==========
- Implement editing of users. Springbind is lacking.
:: Moved to use spring form tag library instead.

- Implement editing of nodes. Springbind is lacking. Should we be able to persiste a new config file!?!?
:: Fixed. Moved to use spring form tag library instead.

-  Fix AJAX timer and updates of message counter in nodes.
:: Fixed

- Nice to have Ajax for node listing: set color on updated row on updates!!!
:: Fixed. Using  scriptaculous.

- Only update using callbacks if something has happended on a node - perhaps update the whole node
and not only the message count!!
:: Fixed
