<!--  
	This example shows two different projects running in // for this system.
	It uses Maven1 as the build manager.
	
	systemcontinuum 	Check cvs every X miutes time period and do a clean
	                    cvs checkout and a complete rebuild using maven.
	                    Failures will be reported to last cvs commiters since
	                    previous successful build.
					
	systemnightly		Builds the report site every night at a specified time.
	
	Deploy a war to an application server - tomcat, geronimo or jboss to be
	able to view the builds and metrics.
	Buildarea is set to	/home/user/cruisebuildarea/ under which a log area is 
	dedicated for logs (used by deployed war in jboss). Logs can be viewed
	under:
	
	http://builder:8081/cruisecontrol/

	Cruisecontrol needs to be started using e.g.:
	
	nohup maven cruisecontrol:run &

	CC_BUILD=/home/user/cruisebuildarea
	CC_INSTALL=/home/user/tools/cruisecontrol-2.2.1/

        <!-- Here you put things you want to be done prior to a build. In our
        case below we want a log statement to be published to a directory -
        it DOES not mean that a build will be run though. -->

        <!-- A build will be attempted if something that a modiicationset is
        watching has changed.
        For very large scale builds try using a modificationsset using
        filesystem instead of cvs (as depicted here). Then let cvs update
        using a trigger a modification file which is watched from this
        modificationsset.
        The quietperiod property means that the modificationset must be quit
        for 120s before a build is attempted. Suppose you are commiting in
        100 file - after 5 files beeing commited cc tries to do a build.
        But there is no chance i hell that the build will success since all
        files beeing committed are not in yet - thats why the quietperiod
        comes in handy. CC will wait for in this case cvs to be quiet before
        trying any build.
