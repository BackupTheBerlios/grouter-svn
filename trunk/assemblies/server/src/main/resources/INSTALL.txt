export GROUTER_HOME=/opt/grouter
export PATH=$PATH:$GROUTER_HOME/bin

set PATH=%PATH%;%GROUTER_HOME%\bin
(or by using the System utility in the Control Panel for Windows NT/2000/XP)


Mysql (macosx)

1. Drop if you have any existing grouter database already.
mysqladmin -u root -pyhepwd DROP grouter;

2. Start up mysql the mysql demon
> sudo ./mysql/bin/mysqld_safe

3. Create database instance:
> mysqladmin -u root -pthepwd  CREATE grouter
And then reload the database
>mysqladmin -u root -pthepwd reload;

4. Grant grouter user
As root create a mingle user
mysql -u root -pthepwd  mysql

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON grouter.* TO 'grouter'@'localhost'  IDENTIFIED BY 'grouter' WITH GRANT OPTION;
