Unpack the distribution into a folder - preferably with no spaces - and then update your path
to point to the installation directory. This will depend on your platform, but is usually 
something like the following:

Linux / Unix / Macos
------------
export GROUTER_HOME=/opt/grouter
export PATH=$PATH:$GROUTER_HOME/bin

Windows
-------
set GROUTER_HOME=C:\grouter
set PATH=%PATH%;%GROUTER_HOME%\bin
(or by using the System utility in the Control Panel for Windows NT/2000/XP)


Mysql (macosx)
-----


1. Drop if you have any existing grouter database already.
mysqladmin -u root -pyhepwd DROP grouter;

2. Start up mysql the mysql demon
> sudo ./mysql/bin/mysqld_safe

3. Create database instance

On MacOSX:
> mysqladmin -u root -pthepwd  CREATE grouter
Reload the database
>mysqladmin -u root -pthepwd reload;

On Windows: 
C:\>"C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.0\bin\mysqladmin" -u root -pthepwd  CREATE grouter
Reload the database:
C:\>"C:\Documents and Settings\pog>"C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.0\bin\mysqladmin" -u root -pthepwd reload


4. Create the "grouter" user and grant access rights

mysql -u root -pthepwd  mysql
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON grouter.* TO 'grouter'@'localhost'  IDENTIFIED BY 'grouter' WITH GRANT OPTION;

On Windows:
C:\>"C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.0\bin\mysql"  -u root -pdmnb330

6 Now Create tables 

Change to where the database file script resides : GROUTER_HOME/database/mysql

mysql> -h localhost -u grouter -pgrouter grouter < main_drop_create.sql

On Windows
C:\grouter\database\mysql>"C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.0\bin\mysql" -h localhost -u grouter -pgrouter grouter < main_drop_
create.sql
