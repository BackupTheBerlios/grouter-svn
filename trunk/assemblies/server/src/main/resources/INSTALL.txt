|      Welcome to Grouter!   |
|----------------------------|
Grouter is a simple messaging broker and scheduler.
See http://grouter.berlios.de/ 

+--------------+
| INSTALLATION |
+--------------+
Unpack the distribution into a folder - preferably with no spaces - and then update your path
to point to the installation directory. This will depend on your platform, but is usually 
something like the following:

Linux / Unix / Macos
------------
export GROUTER_HOME=/opt/grouter
export PATH=$PATH:$GROUTER_HOME/bin

Windows
-------
set GROUTER_HOME=C:\grouter
set PATH=%PATH%;%GROUTER_HOME%\bin
(or by using the System utility in the Control Panel for Windows NT/2000/XP)

+--------------+
| DISTRIBUTION |
+--------------+
The distribution you have downloaded contains the following:

./bin          - Shell and batch scripts for controlling Grouter from the command line
./conf         - Configuration files
./docs         - API documentation (javadoc) for Grouter and its sub-projects
./lib/boot     - Libraries used by the Java Service Wrapper to boot up the server
./lib/grouter  - Grouter libraries
./lib/opt      - Non-Grouter libraries
./lib/user     - This is where you should place your custom classes/libraries.
                 This directory comes before ./lib/grouter on the classpath and can
                 therefore be used to patch the distributed Grouter classes if necessary.
./licences     - License information for all libraries shipped with Grouter
./logs         - Output will be sent here by default when running in background mode
./sbin         - Internal scripts which are not to be run by the user
./INSTALL.txt  - this file!
./LICENSE.txt  - License agreement for Grouter
./USAGE.txt    - Basic usage of Grouter from the command-line
