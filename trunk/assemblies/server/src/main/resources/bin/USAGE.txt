grouter  (runs in the foreground, stop with Ctrl-C)

grouter start|stop|restart    (runs in the background as a daemon)

| CONFIGURATION FILES |
+---------------------+

Your configuration file(s) need to be on the classpath prior to startup.  A convenient
way to achieve this is by placing them in the "conf". Alternatively, you can specify an 
explicit path to their location on the file system.

Under /conf there is a file called wrapper.conf in which you can configure a lot of things
amongst them which configuration file grouter should use. Under conf/examples you can find
different config files to use.

Under /conf there is a config.xsd which specifies what you can put into a grouter config
file. This is very helpful if you have a good editor that cn help you with autocompletion
of xml elements.
